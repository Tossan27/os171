1.
a. global-char uses global variables while local-char uses local variables
   address allocated for global variabels stays between multiple runs while on local variables changes every runs

b. global variables stored using 6 digit address (24 bit) while local variables stored using 12 digit address (48 bit)

c. global variables stored at the program data while local variables stored at the program stack

2.
a. flag is used to determine what the open function will do with file(read only or write only or why not both and other stuff)

b. modes is to determine the file permission for user, group, and othersso they can read it or not, write it or not, execute it or not

c. modes can't be changed once the file is already exist
   modes also can't overwrite umask

3.
The file output is not as expected because of 2 file descriptor being opened simultaneously
The second fd overwrites what the first fd is writing so that the "AAAX" is replaced by "CCC\n"
The solution is to use a dup instead of opening a second fd
